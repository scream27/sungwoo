I am a PhD student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I'll be graduating in May 2023. My research interest lies in enumeratie algebraic geometry. My advisor is [Sheldon Katz](https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~katz/). Here is my [CV](https://scream27.github.io/sungwoo/files/CV-webpage.pdf).

I am currently on the job market. Feel free to contact me at [sungwoo2@illinois.edu](mailto:sungwoo2@illinois.edu).
